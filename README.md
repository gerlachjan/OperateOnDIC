This script is designed to analyze DIC (Digital Image Correlation) data obtained during tensile loading of flat specimens (DP800) until fracture . The script calculates the current cross-section based on the point cloud obtained by the DIC data. Furthermore the script visualize field quantities such as equivalent Mises strain in 2D and 3D.
